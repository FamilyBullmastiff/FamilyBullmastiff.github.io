<p>Originally from England in 1860, the Bullmastiff is a cross between old English Mastiff and old English Bulldog. The bullmastiff was bred to capture and hold poachers for the gamekeepers of an estate. As such, these dogs are well-known for their speed, strength, and endurance. Yet, despite this somewhat fearsome history, these dogs are also excellent and devoted family pets: obedient, courageous, tolerant of children and other animals, and instinctively ready to guard that which they feel belongs to the home. As with all dogs, the character of your dog depends on their breeding, temperament, and their training environment from the day they are born. Firm training and establishing boundaries is the key to ensuring a successful integration into the home environment.</p>
